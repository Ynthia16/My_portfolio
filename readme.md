# My Personal Resume Website

## Overview
This is my personal resume website, showcasing my skills, experiences, and projects in the field of web development. It's designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

### Approach
#### Technical Stack
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I've built this website from scratch using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Responsive Design: I've employed media queries and relative units like EM and percentages to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

Custom CSS: No frameworks like Bootstrap were used; I've customized the CSS to create a unique design, experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript Interactivity: I've added JavaScript to introduce interactivity, such as a responsive navbar and maybe a few other features (e.g., image sliders).
#### Portfolio Content
Skills: I've included a section detailing my technical and soft skills, even though I'm relatively new to web development. I'm eager to learn and dedicated to growing my skills.
About Me: The "About Me" section provides a brief introduction to me as a software engineering student specializing in web development. I have a passion for this field and am actively working on personal web projects.
Projects: You'll find examples of my work, even if I have just started. I'm actively building my portfolio, and each project comes with a brief description, highlighting what I've learned.
Contact Info: You can reach out to me via[c.umugwanez@alustudent.com]for inquiries, collaborations, or discussions.
#### Validation and Compatibility
I've ensured that the website validates without errors in HTML and CSS using W3C validation tools.
I've tested the website's functionality and appearance on various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
### Unique Design
I've created a unique design for this website, ensuring that the content and style are not copied from templates. It reflects my individuality and creative approach to web development.
